 *** Data Manipulation and Cleaning in Python course ***

## Course Intent

This course will go over the core libraries for handling data in Python.
You'll walk away with practical experience manipulating messy,
real-world data using libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy and
matplotlib. Will also get a firm understanding of tools like pip, git,
pdb and unit testing.


The class will work on two sample projects: one will be to scrape
picture captions off a website, extract the names of those in the
picture, graph the friendship relationships among those individuals and
infer insights about their connections. The other project will be to
assemble a database of restaurant inspection data, then query it to see
the variations in scores, violations and types of restaurants.
